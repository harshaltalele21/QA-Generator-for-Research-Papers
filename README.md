Dynamic QA Generator for Research Papers using the T5 model

Researchers spend a great deal of time studying research papers. Comprehending an entire paper in a single pass is highly difficult. A study suggests that the most efficient way to understand the paper would be using the three-pass approach, which involves reading the paper three times with a different focus each time. However, this process is tedious and time- consuming. A simpler way to understand the paper would be just to go through the abstract. However, a lot of key aspects like evaluation metrics, implementation details, mathematical explanations, etc. may be missed out in the abstract. There is a need for an efficient summarization method which helps interpret the paper in a more detailed way. Our proposed solution uses the Search and extract behaviour of the question- answering model to help in a better interpretation of the paper. For this purpose, we use a pre-trained model T5 and fine tune it on QASPER dataset modified using OpenAI.
